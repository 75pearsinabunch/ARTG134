						<h3></h3>
						<p style="font-size:25px">Company founder and CEO Mr. E started Hindsight at the beginning
							of 2020. Previously, Hindsight was known under a different name as
							a startup focused on speedy local deliveries. Foreseeing the
							pandemic spreading worldwide as news about COVID-19 was rapidly
							being released, Mr. E knew that the needs of the people came first
							and transformed his previous business into what we know as
							Hindsight today. His efforts have been completely focused on
							improving the lives of all of us while we are coping with this
							“new normal,” completely throwing away his previous business
							venture in order to provide broader services for more people
							everywhere.</p>
						<p style="font-size:25px">“Ironically, I foresaw the future and predicted that a company
							like Hindsight was what the world needed. Being stuck at home and
							trying to go out as little as possible meant that it was necessary
							to provide people service to their front doors. When I saw my
							friends and family begin to suffer because of the pandemic, that
							really motivated me to find a solution and continue to invest in
							and grow Hindsight.”</p>
						<p style="font-size:25px">Mr. E’s business ventures have gained attention from investors
							before, but Hindsight particularly was able to grow and expand its
							horizons more than ever before. His difficult upbringing
							cultivated an empathetic mindset, which shines through in his work.
							As Hindsight continues to grow, Mr. E continues to dream bigger.</p>
