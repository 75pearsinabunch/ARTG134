									<h1>Meet Our Team</h1>
								</header>
								<p>Hindsight is a multi sectoral company working hard to bring clients satisfying experiences.
									Hindsight manufactures products, ships and sells them to customers, and leads the cutting edge of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
									Here at Hindsight, we are dedicated to customer satisfaction.
									We use advanced artificial intelligence and self driving automobile technology to ensure timely and safe service.
									Hindsight isn’t just committed to making our customers happy.
									We also create tens of thousands of jobs every year, allowing our hard workers to go home and feed their families.</p>
								<h2>Hindsight's Members</h2>
								<p>With this in mind, our 'meet our team' section is a great way to illustrate that idea.
									When you hover over an image of a team member in the gallery, their thumbnail reveals a small caption of what they wanted to be when they grew up.
									The idea being that it takes time and innovation to become great things.</p>

										<h3>Drone</h3>
										<p>
											We're excited about Air buddy — a future delivery system from Hindsight designed to safely get packages to customers in 30 minutes or less using unmanned aerial vehicles, also called drones.
											Air buddy has great potential to enhance the services we already provide to millions of customers by providing rapid parcel delivery that will also increase the overall safety and efficiency of the transportation system.
