										<h3>Tydrone</h3>

											We're excited about Air buddy — a future delivery system from Hindsight designed to safely get packages to customers in 30 minutes or less using unmanned aerial vehicles, also called drones.

										<h3></h3>
										<p>
											Company founder and CEO Mr. E started Hindsight at the beginning of 2020. Previously, Hindsight was known under a different name as a startup focused on speedy local deliveries. Foreseeing the pandemic spreading worldwide as news about COVID-19 was rapidly being released, Mr. E knew that the needs of the people came first and transformed his previous business into what we know as Hindsight today. His efforts have been completely focused on improving the lives of all of us while we are coping with this “new normal,” completely throwing away his previous business venture in order to provide broader services for more people everywhere.
										</p>
										<p>
											“Ironically, I foresaw the future and predicted that a company like Hindsight was what the world needed. Being stuck at home and trying to go out as little as possible meant that it was necessary to provide people service to their front doors. When I saw my friends and family begin to suffer because of the pandemic, that really motivated me to find a solution and continue to invest in and grow Hindsight.”
										</p>
										<p>
											Mr. E’s business ventures have gained attention from investors before, but Hindsight particularly was able to grow and expand its horizons more than ever before. His difficult upbringing cultivated an empathetic mindset, which shines through in his work. As Hindsight continues to grow, Mr. E continues to dream bigger.
